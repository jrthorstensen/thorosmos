# thorosmos
Programs for reducing data from MDM's OSMOS instrument. 

Requires an IRAF/pyraf environment (e.g. 'iraf27') and also my thorsky module.

Aimed mostly at reducing stellar spectra.  Also includes an HTML tutorial.

Just download the .tar.gz, unpack, and start reading the manual in the 'doc' subdirectory of thorosmos.
